# 01-finalProjectFolder
I'm new to git hub so some of the things i did probably don't make sense but maybe i'll do better next tiem.
the development code is in the version 2 folder, the version 1 folder contains code for line following with no pid controls in place
version 2 describes the development of the code throughout the process of adding and tuning the p, i, and d, gains.
maybe i'll try to include some videos of the no pid and the final versions with the pid control in place and tuned.
